# Imperishabe-Full-Moon - Werewolf in Space

First 3D game I created

This game was created as a part of a course at Blekinge Institute of Technology for my Master's in Game and Software Engineering.


The game is taking place on a planet similar to earth, but inhabited by sentient Wolves. 

You are controlling one of the wolves, navigating throu levels by jumping between platforms.

Game engine and all assets are created from scratch.
